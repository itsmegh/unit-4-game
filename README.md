# CrystalCollector

This application is a game that displays four crystals with a random number assigned to each. The player is shown a "total value" goal at the game start. To win, the player must click on the crystals and match the "total value" goal. The application keeps track of a player's wins and losses.

Game design notes

The random number shown at the start of the game is programmed to be between 19 - 120.
Each crystal has a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
